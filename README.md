# Cryptocurrencies
### Overview:
The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report including the traded cryptocurrencies classified by group according to their features. This report is used by an investment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients. It includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. 

We use the following methods for the analysis:
- Data Preprocessing to prepare for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means
- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means
- Visualizing Results to create plots and data tables

We have prepared the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means, reduced data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn, predicted clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn, and created some plots and data tables to present the clustering results.
